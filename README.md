<h1>SIEM Integration: Wazuh Open Source Security</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

I spearheaded the implementation of the Wazuh Open Source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system as the inaugural SIEM solution for our organization. Focused on monitoring active endpoints, this cost-effective initiative marks a significant milestone as it establishes our company's first centralized event log monitoring system. The decision to opt for an open-source platform reflects my strategic approach, emphasizing cost-saving measures without compromising on security. The SIEM deployment, complemented by alert capabilities on Slack, ensures prompt response to any unusual activities. This pioneering effort not only highlights my dedication to advancing our cybersecurity infrastructure but also showcases the benefits of a robust SIEM solution for proactive threat detection and response.
